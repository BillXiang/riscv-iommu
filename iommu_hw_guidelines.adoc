== Hardware guidelines
This section provides guidelines to the system/hardware integrator of the 
IOMMU in the platform.

=== Integrating an IOMMU as a PCIe device
The IOMMU may be constructed as a PCIe device itself and be discoverable
as a dedicated PCIe function with PCIe defined Base Class 08h, Sub-Class 06h, 
and Programming Interface 00h.

Such IOMMU must map the IOMMU registers defined in this specification as PCIe
BAR mapped registers.

The IOMMU may support MSI or MSI-X or both. When MSI-X is supported,  the MSI-X
capability block must point to the msi_tbl in BAR mapped registers such that
system software can configure MSI address and data pairs for each message 
supported by the IOMMU. The MSI-X PBA may be located in the same BAR or 
another BAR of the IOMMU. The IOMMU is recommended to support MSI-X capability.
